Here you will find a full analysis of the video game purchases of people using pandas.


Observations can be found in the analysis file, and the original csv can be found in the resources file


Throughout the code, you will find out how I grouped the data in order to perform a demographic analysis, taking a deeper dive in order to find out how different age groups and genders purchase games differently. 


Enjoy!
